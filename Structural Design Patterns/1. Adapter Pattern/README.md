Adapter Pattern:

The Adapter Pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together by acting as a translator or wrapper around an existing class. It converts the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects.

It acts as a bridge between the Target interface (expected by the client) and the Adaptee(an existing class with a different interface). This structural wrapping enables integration and compatibility across diverse systems.

The adpater allows your charger (with its Indian plug) to fit the European socket, enabling charging without modifying either the socket or the charger,
